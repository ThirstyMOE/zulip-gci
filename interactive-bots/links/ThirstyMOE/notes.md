Problems during setup:

Downloading .zuliprc configuration file from the links bot created was not responding?
There was a work around of making a .zuliprc file separately with correct API key, email and dev-url.

Running the links bot correctly was slightly unclear. Did not know to use two simultaneous Git Bash consoles to run VM and local links bot respectively.
